# quantum-gravity-nisrine-chafik-simulations
Simulation repository for quantum gravity framework by Nisrine Chafik. Includes reproducible code for figures in Appendix C and E.


the Quantum Gravity Simulations project

This repository contains all reproducible simulations, numerical models, and code modules used in the official quantum gravity framework developed by **Nisrine Chafik**. These simulations validate theoretical predictions in the research paper titled *"The Solution to the Quantum Gravity Problem: Unifying General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics through Discrete Geometry and Emergent Entanglement."*

Contents

- `notebooks/` â€” Jupyter notebooks for each simulation (quantum echoes, Hawking radiation corrections, CMB tensor modes, etc.)
- `images/` â€” Rendered graphs and simulation outputs used in the paper
- `docs/` â€” Documentation on numerical methods, parameter sweeps, and model assumptions

Simulations Included

- Quantum Echo Waveforms (Fig C.1)
- Hawking Radiation Spectrum Deviations (Fig C.2)
- CMB B-Mode Polarization Forecast (Fig C.3)
